# Files Overview
This repository contains two Python files, both created in a Colab environment, designed to introduce key concepts and practical examples in using **Matplotlib** for data visualization. These files will be particularly useful for those new to matplotlib or anyone wanting to deepen their understanding of how different modules work together to create flexible plots.

### *Matplotlib Graphs.ipynb*
This file provides a comprehensive overview of matplotlib’s essential components, such as **Pyplot**, **Figure**, **Axes**, **Ticks**, **Labels**, and **Legends**. Along with these, the file includes examples of multi-plots and demonstrates how to arrange plots using both the ***pyplot.add_axes()*** method and the more straightforward ***pyplot.subplots()*** method. The examples here are meant to help users get hands-on experience and learn how to apply matplotlib's versatile plotting tools in their own projects.

### *Matplotlib Axes.ipynb*
This file focuses more specifically on the ***pyplot.add_axes()*** method. Since this method can be a bit confusing. The file highlights some of the challenges you might face while using it. It also breaks down how the method’s parameters work as fractions of the figure’s dimensions. If you're primarily interested in learning this method, this file will guide you through it with clear examples and explanations.
